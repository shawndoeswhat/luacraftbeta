## Installation

To build **LuaCraftBeta**, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. Install `luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar` to Your Local Maven Repository

Before building the project, you need to install the `luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar` file into your local Maven repository.

- Download the `luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar` from the [official release page](https://github.com/luaj/luaj/releases/download/v3.0.2/luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar).
- Once downloaded, use the following Maven command to install it into your local repository:

```bash
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./jars/luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar -DgroupId=org.luaj -DartifactId=luaj-jse -Dversion=3.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar
```

This will install the `luaj-jse-3.0.2.jar` in your local Maven repository.

### 2. Download or Clone the Repository

You can download or clone the repository to your Minecraft server's plugin directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawnjb/LuaCraftBeta.git
```

### 3. Build the Plugin

Make sure you have **Maven** installed and then run the following command to build the plugin.

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 4. Deploy the Plugin

After building, you will find the plugin `.jar` file in the `target/` directory. Move this `.jar` file to your Minecraft server's `plugins/` folder.

### 5. Start the Server

Launch your Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 server with the plugin installed.

### 6. Enjoy Lua Scripting

Once the server starts, you can execute Lua scripts using the `/loadscript [scriptName]` command.

## Usage

### Running Scripts:

To run a script, use the `/loadscript` command in the server. For example:

```bash
/loadscript myscript.lua
```

This will load and execute the `myscript.lua` file located in the `plugins/LuaCraftBeta/scripts/` directory.

### Documentation:

The plugin automatically generates a `docs.lua` file with LuaCATS-compatible documentation. After building, you can find it in:

```
src/main/resources/docs/docs.lua
```

This file contains detailed documentation on how to use the API, including the available classes and methods such as **Player**, **World**, **Entity**, and **Block**. The documentation will assist you in writing your Lua scripts.

### Debugging:

When running scripts, you can enable debug mode to log extra details about the script execution. This can be done by adding `debug` as a second argument to the `/loadscript` command:

```bash
/loadscript myscript.lua debug
```

---

## Commands

- **/loadscript [scriptName]**: Loads and executes the specified Lua script.
- **/loadscript [scriptName] debug**: Loads and executes the Lua script with debug logging enabled.
